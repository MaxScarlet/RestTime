Description:
    RestTime is the final project for John Bryce Full Stack Web Development course aimed at providing Frontend UI and RESTful API for managing vacation offers. 
    The project is designed to streamline the process of scheduling and tracking various vacations through a user-friendly interface.
    It offers endpoints for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving vacations, along with authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to the API.

Features:
  CRUD Operations: RestTime supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing offers.
  Authentication and Authorization: The project includes authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to the UI features.
  Customer features: Users can search and like offers provided on the website.
  Admin features: Admins can create, update and suspend vacation offers on the website after a proper login.
  RESTful Design: RestTime follows RESTful principles, providing a standardized and intuitive API interface for interacting with offers.

Technologies:
  Node.js: RestTime is built using Node.js, a popular runtime environment for server-side JavaScript applications.
  Express.js: The project utilizes Express.js, a minimalist web framework for Node.js, to handle HTTP requests and routing.
  MongoDB: RestTime stores data using MongoDB, a scalable and flexible NoSQL database, ensuring efficient management of time-based resources.
  JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Authentication in RestTime is implemented using JWT tokens, providing a stateless authentication mechanism.
  Mongoose: Mongoose is used as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, simplifying interactions with the database.
